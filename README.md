### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following, replacing the placeholder values with your MySQL database credentials:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_NAME=your_db_name
    ```

4.  **Initialize the database:**

    Connect to your MySQL instance and run the SQL script located at `backend/init-db.sql` to create the necessary tables.

5.  **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following:

    ```
    API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
